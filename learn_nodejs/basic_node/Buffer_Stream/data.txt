Hello..

Three years ago Salingu’s good fortune began to fade. His vision was failing and he was desperate.

Getting around in the countryside is hard when you can’t see. With no car and one bus a day he couldn’t get to the doctor on his own. When it rained he couldn’t get anywhere because the dirt roads flooded. One of his children had to quit farming and stay home to take care of him.

He felt isolated and helpless.

His children heard that an eye screening team would be visiting the area. At the Seva supported hospital in Singida, Tanzania he received cataract surgery to restore his sight.

At last he could see his grandson’s face.






Three-year-old Milka lives in a village in the small, war-torn country of Burundi just south of Rwanda. When Milka started walking at age 1, she didn't progress the way most children do and kept bumping into things.

An outreach worker told Milka's mother about a Seva-supported eye clinic in Bujumbura, Burundi's largest city. Her mother had never traveled to the city, but she put Milka in her fanciest dress and made the journey. At the eye clinic, Milka was seen by Dr. Levi Kandeke, Burundi's sole pediatric ophthalmologist who relies on NGOs like Seva to provide funding so he can take care of the many children with vision problems but whose families cannot afford eye care.

Thanks to the generosity of donors like you, Milka was diagnosed with severe nearsightedness and received a pair of pretty pink eyeglasses that correct her vision. Milka will be able to attend Kindergarten this fall and make the most of her education with clear vision.
